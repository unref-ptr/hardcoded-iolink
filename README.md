## Hard Coded IO-Link:

IO-Link Device for use with the Arduino platform. As the name imples, the IO-Link device stack is hardcoded and does not comply with the IO-Link specification. In general it can be used to test IO-Link communication and learn how it works in general. You can try using this softwware with an IO-Link Transciever (e.g. TIOL-111). Further than that, the SW does not include use of Parameters, Events or DS. It implements the most simplest way to communicate and recieve data from an IO-Link Master (PD Out).

#### Improvements:

You are welcome to improve the software and include features that are not part of this implementation by forking and creating a merge request.

#### Further information:

For more informaiton RTFM or in this case the IO-Link specification :)
